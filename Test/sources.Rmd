This application explores the concentration of business critical models by department.

## Modelling Departments 
This tab plots the distribution of models by department against analytical headcount. The idea is that departments with both a high concentration of models and a high headcount with have greater needs in terms of Quality Assurance of their models. The Size of the bubble plot is the department DEL. A department in the top tight quandrant with a large bubble will indcate departments to target. 

## Distribution of Models by Department
This tab repoduces chart 3.A, p.g 26, of the MacPeherson Report but with the departmental list I have used in the first tab for the analaysis. See later for more.

Government uses to control spending. Departments have separate resource and capital
budgets. Each of these is divided into Departmental Expenditure Limits (DEL) and Annually
Managed Expenditure (AME).

## Departments
Since the publication of the MacPherson report the departmental list has slightly changed. This has not affected most of the departments or the largest departments by business critical models. 
The departments that have been affect are 
* BEIS = BIS, DECC, CCC
* Other = other, FSA, GAD
Employment data for Other comes from FSA and GAD only, so this will under represent the employment count, perhaps significantly. This is due to now being able to disaggreate data supplied.
